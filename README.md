# Hellgate Demos

This is a repository for demonstrations of code that runs on the University of Montana's Hellgate HPC cluster.  

The intention is to provide working examples that others can modify for their own uses. Use cases include:
- 1-node SLURM jobs with conda environments
- 1-node SLURM jobs with apptainer containers
- Multi-node SLURM jobs (parallelize across nodes)
- <hopefully more coming soon!>
