# Count Features

In this example, I count the number of features (parks, schools, sports fields) that are present in a set previously downloaded GIS files (see 'osm_download_1-node'). There is 1 GIS file for each of the 3,223 counties in the continental US (CONUS). 

While it's quite a bit of data, this operation is well within the reasonable capabilities of a personal computer. The HPC - and apptainer - was utilized mostly for learning purposes.
